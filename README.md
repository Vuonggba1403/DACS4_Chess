# ♔ Python Chess Engine ♕



## Technologies

* Python
* pygame 

## How to play

* Press `z` to undo a move.
* Press `r` to reset the game.
## Further development ideas
    1. Ordering the moves (ex. looking at checks and/or captures) should make the engine much quicker (because of the alpha-beta pruning).
    2. Keeping track of all the possible moves in a given position, so that after a move is made the engine doesn't have to recalculate all the moves.
    3. Evaluating kings placement on the board (separate in middle game and in the late game).
    4. Book of openings.
